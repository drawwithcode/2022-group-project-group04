# Delph⋅E

Delph⋅E is a virtual space that aims to make tangible the presence of technology and profiling algorithms in everyday life. Every time a user surfs the Internet, he unknowingly leaves behind a trail of data. This data is collected and exploited by profiling algorithms to 'know' the user and return 'tailored' recommendations, showing only what the user might like.
