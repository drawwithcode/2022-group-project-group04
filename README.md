# Delph⋅E

Delph⋅E is a virtual space that aims to make tangible the presence of technology and profiling algorithms in everyday life. Every time a user surfs the Internet, he unknowingly leaves behind a trail of data. This data is collected and exploited by profiling algorithms to 'know' the user and return 'tailored' recommendations, showing only what the user might like.

# THE PROJECT

**THEME: THE PRESENCE**

*"Is there a usage of technology that makes it **present, tangible, persistent**?"*

We imagined technology as being an ever-vigilant entity. Always present. With an eye constantly on the user. It monitors our activities so as to classify and assimilate them into larger patterns.
It collects endless amounts of data about our actions and movements by studying them to the point of being able to predict them. 

So, the question is: "Are the algorithms the **new crystal ball or even the 21st Century Oracle of Delphi?**"

Profiling algorithms tend to to draw stereotypical profiles to which they propose sometimes inaccurate recommendations.
Users are not always aware of the ways in which the network collects their data to exploit it in profiling processes. 

The goal of our project is to make the profiling algorithm very tangible, raw, and coarse, highlighting the moment it collects data and translates it into recommendations.


**CONCEPT**

<!--Immagine concept-->

Delph⋅E replicates this experience, making it intentionally coarse and stereotypical. Through some explicit technologies such facial expression recognition, the website collects user’s emotions and reactions to certain content to extort his preferences and make a series of decisions about him. The profilation uses also some implicit datas, that the user is not aware  he is giving during the experience such as the time spent watching the gifs. The result is the flattening of the user, associated with a false and stereotypical identity model.

The name "Delph⋅E" comes from the algorithms' ambition not only to know everything about the world but to know everything about yourself.  The most famous  Delphic maxim in the Ancient Greek was indeed "know thyself".


**CONTEXT OF USE**

The project was conceived for the context of an exhibition.

In the exhibition, to make the experience more immersive we thought to have a single screen with a keyboard and a mouse surrounded by multiple stereos to attract the attention of people passing by. When nobody is doing the experience at the monitor, the voice of the algorithm will call for the passers-by's attention until they click and start the experience.


**STRUCTURE**

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Home**
The user is welcomed and attracted to join the expirience. 

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Name**
The algorithm kindly asks the user's name. This will the only information that the user willingly provides to the website. 

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Face Recognition**
The algorithm will analyze the user's gender, age and emotions through the webcam. The user knows that these informations are explicitly taken by the algorithm, but she/he don't know for what purpose they will be used.  

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Loading**
In this part, while the user's waiting for the loading to end, the website will take the implicit information about her/his behaviours: if the user remains still and doesn't interact with the website then the algorithm will consider he/she as a "chill person", otherwise the user will appear nevrotic. 

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Reacting to GIFs**
The algorithm will take count of the amount of time the user spends on each gif. This will be another implicit information taken into account. 

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Report**
The website will give a coarse report about the user's profile.  

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Recommendations**
In the end, the algorith will do what every profiling algorithm does: to give recommendations. 

<!--Immagine structure-->
**Review**
At he end, the website will let the user leave a comment about the whole experience, but in reality the user won't be able to express his/her opinion because the algorithm thinks to already know it.
