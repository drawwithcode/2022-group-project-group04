# Delph⋅E

Delph⋅E is a virtual space that aims to make tangible the presence of technology and profiling algorithms in everyday life. Every time a user surfs the Internet, he unknowingly leaves behind a trail of data. This data is collected and exploited by profiling algorithms to 'know' the user and return 'tailored' recommendations, showing only what the user might like.

# THE PROJECT

**THEME: THE PRESENCE**

*"Is there a usage of technology that makes it **present, tangible, persistent**?"*

We imagined technology as being an ever-vigilant entity. Always present. With an eye constantly on the user. It monitors our activities so as to classify and assimilate them into larger patterns.
It collects endless amounts of data about our actions and movements by studying them to the point of being able to predict them. 

So, the question is: "Are the algorithms the **new crystal ball or even the 21st Century Oracle of Delphi?**"

Profiling algorithms tend to to draw stereotypical profiles to which they propose sometimes inaccurate recommendations.
Users are not always aware of the ways in which the network collects their data to exploit it in profiling processes. 

The goal of our project is to make the profiling algorithm very tangible, raw, and coarse, highlighting the moment it collects data and translates it into recommendations.


**CONCEPT**

Delph⋅E replicates this experience, making it intentionally coarse and stereotypical. Through some explicit technologies such facial expression recognition, the website collects user’s emotions and reactions to certain content to extort his preferences and make a series of decisions about him. The profilation uses also some implicit datas, that the user is not aware  he is giving during the experience such as the time spent watching the gifs. The result is the flattening of the user, associated with a false and stereotypical identity model.

The name "Delph⋅E" comes from the algorithms' ambition not only to know everything about the world but to know everything about yourself.  The most famous  Delphic maxim in the Ancient Greek was indeed "know thyself".
